#  🧬 Java Inheritance: Private Variables & Method Override
This project demonstrates key OOP concepts in Java—specifically inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.

## 📦 Structure
🔹 Super Class
• 	Contains private variables to enforce encapsulation.
• 	Provides public getters/setters for controlled access.
• 	Includes a method that will be overridden in the subclass.

## 🔸 Sub Class
• 	Inherits from the super class.
• 	Overrides a method to customize behavior.
• 	Accesses private variables via inherited getters/setters.

## 💡 Key Concepts
• 	(private) variables are not directly accessible in subclasses.
• 	Method overriding allows custom behavior while preserving inheritance.
• 	Demonstrates clean OOP design with encapsulation and polymorphism.
